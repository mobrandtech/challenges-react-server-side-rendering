Build a simple Form -> Response using React Server Side Rendering.

### Goal
- Build a Server Side Rendering Form
  - Use NodeJs and React together
- Use and install all the necessary NPM packages


### The Form

- It should have the fields:
  - URL - a free text input.
  - Platform - a select box with ANDROID or IOS.
  - Country - a select box with at least 5 countries.

- On submit it should redirect to the Result page


### The Result

- It should render a page based with a fixed or random result
- It should get the result on backend asynchronously
  - for example, by calling an API, which can be mocked with a fixed or random response


### Must have
- Server Side Rendering Form
- Server Side Rendering Result
- Result must be retrieved asynchronously
- CSS to allow both pages to be usable


### Nice to have
- Mocked NodeJs API
- CSS closely matching the examples
- Tests
